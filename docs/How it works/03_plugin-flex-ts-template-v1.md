This package is the actual flex plugin and a structure is already laid out that makes it a lot easier to work in a distributed development model. More details of the package structure are discussed [over here](https://github.com/twilio-professional-services/flex-project-template/tree/main/plugin-flex-ts-template-v1) the plugin has a library of examples that can be turned on or off, or if desired can be removed completely with little overhead. The utilities in this package are designed around the associated serverless-functions and leverage the associated flex-config.
