This package is identical in purpose to the `plugin-flex-ts-template-v1` except its intended for flex v2 projects which are discussed more [over here](/Setup%20Guides/building-with-template). The intention is when kicking off a project or feature the owner would fork the repository or start a clean repository using the clone template function, then delete the plugin version they are not using.
